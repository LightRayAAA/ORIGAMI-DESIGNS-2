Hi! I'm Ray! I like to write programs, compose music, and much more! This website specifically was created as a project for a coding class that I'm taking.<br>
I like origami a lot, and spent a lot of my childhood folding paper into many shapes. Mainly paper airplanes.<br>
I enjoy working on programs as well, and spent of a lot of my childhood on coding platforms such as <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch.</a><br>
I had a lot of fun making this website as it's my first experience with html!
I hope you enjoy this website and even consider making one or two of these projects!<br><br>
Bye!
